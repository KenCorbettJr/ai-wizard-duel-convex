# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Wizard Duel feature enables players to engage in turn-based magical combat where they create and control wizards that battle each other through multiple rounds. Each round involves players submitting spell actions that are processed by an AI model to generate narrative descriptions of the magical combat, award points for creativity and effectiveness, and track health points. The system determines winners based on either total points accumulated or by elimination when a wizard's health reaches zero.
