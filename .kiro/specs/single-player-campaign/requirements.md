# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Single Player Campaign Mode feature allows players to take their created wizards on structured adventures against AI-powered opponents. This mode provides a progression-based experience where players can test their wizards against increasingly challenging AI opponents, earn rewards, and unlock new campaign stages. The campaign mode serves as both a training ground for new players and an engaging single-player experience that complements the existing multiplayer dueling system.
