# Navigation Flow Improvements

## Problem

When users created a duel, they would see a success page with a "View Duel" button. Clicking this button would take them to the duel detail page, but if the duel was still waiting for players, they would see a waiting message and couldn't easily get back to the join flow to share the duel or see the join interface.

## Solution

Enhanced the duel page to handle all duel states in one place, eliminating redirect loops:

### 1. Duel Creation Flow

**Before**: Create duel → Success page → Click "View Duel" → Duel detail page (waiting message)
**After**: Create duel → Automatically redirect to duel detail page → Enhanced duel page with join functionality

### 2. Direct Duel Access

**Before**: Navigate to `/duels/{id}` for waiting duel → See waiting message (stuck)
**After**: Navigate to `/duels/{id}` for waiting duel → Enhanced duel page with join functionality

### 3. Join via Shortcode

**Before**: Navigate to `/join/{shortcode}` → Separate join interface
**After**: Navigate to `/join/{shortcode}` → Automatically redirect to `/duels/{id}` → Enhanced duel page

## Changes Made

### `src/app/duels/create/page.tsx`

- Modified `handleSuccess` function to redirect directly to `/duels/${duelId}` instead of setting `createdDuelId` state
- This bypasses the success page and goes straight to the duel page, which then redirects to join page

### `src/app/duels/[id]/page.tsx`

- **Removed redirect logic** to prevent infinite redirect loops
- **Enhanced waiting state UI** to include join functionality directly on the duel page
- Added wizard selection interface for non-participants
- Added join duel functionality with `useMutation(api.duels.joinDuel)`
- Added sharing interface for duel creators
- Added proper state management for joining (`selectedWizard`, `isJoining`)
- **Fixed React hooks order**: All hooks called before any conditional returns

### `src/app/join/[shortcode]/page.tsx`

- **Added automatic redirect** to duel page when duel is found
- Simplified flow: shortcode → duel page (no separate join interface)

## Benefits

1. **No Redirect Loops**: Single page handles all duel states without bouncing between pages
2. **Unified Experience**: All duel functionality (viewing, joining, sharing) in one place
3. **Better Context**: Users can see the challenging wizard and duel details while joining
4. **Simplified Navigation**: Fewer page transitions, more intuitive flow
5. **Enhanced Sharing**: Duel creators see sharing options directly on the duel page

## Affected User Flows

All these flows now lead to the enhanced duel page:

- Creating a new duel → Enhanced duel page with sharing options
- Clicking "View" on a duel list item → Enhanced duel page with join functionality
- Using shortcode `/join/{shortcode}` → Redirects to enhanced duel page
- Direct navigation to `/duels/{id}` URLs → Enhanced duel page with appropriate state

## Technical Notes

### React Hooks Rules

The implementation follows React's Rules of Hooks:

- All hooks are called at the top level of the component
- No hooks are called inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
- All hooks are called before any conditional returns

This prevents React errors like "Rendered fewer hooks than expected" and "Cannot update a component while rendering".

### Navigation Architecture

- **Single Source of Truth**: The duel page (`/duels/{id}`) handles all duel states
- **No Redirect Loops**: Join shortcode page redirects once to duel page, then stays there
- **State-Based UI**: Duel page shows different interfaces based on duel status and user participation

## Testing

The changes maintain backward compatibility and improve the user experience without breaking existing functionality. Users will now always end up in the most appropriate place based on the duel's current status.
